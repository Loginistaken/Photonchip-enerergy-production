Photonic Chip Architecture Specification for New Energy Blockchain Simulation
1. Introduction

Purpose:
This photonic chip converts blockchain transaction gas usage into quantifiable photon emissions, simulating energy outputs tied to computation.

Role:
Serves as a hardware-analog model to measure and represent computational cost as physical photon energy, linking blockchain logic to physical energy phenomena.
2. Physical Principles

    Photon Energy Formula:
    E=h×f=hcλE=h×f=λhc​
    where:

        h=6.626×10−34h=6.626×10−34 Js (Planck’s constant)

        c=3×108c=3×108 m/s (speed of light)

        λλ = photon wavelength (dependent on chip design)

        ff = frequency

    Conversion Efficiency:
    Not all gas consumption is perfectly converted; efficiency ηη models losses.

    Temperature Effects:
    Operating temperature influences photon emission rates and energy distribution.

3. Chip Architecture

Core Components:

    Photon Emitter Array: Emits photons based on input signals proportional to gas used.

    Energy Conversion Unit: Calculates energy per photon and total emission energy.

    Control Logic: Receives gas usage input, calculates photon count and controls emission.

    Sensors: Monitor temperature and adjust output accordingly.

Inputs:

    Digital signals representing blockchain transaction gas usage.

Outputs:

    Photon bursts measurable in counts and energy metrics.

4. Photon Emission Model

    Energy Per Photon:
    Ephoton=hcλEphoton​=λhc​

    Total Photons Emitted:
    N=η×GasUsed×KN=η×GasUsed×K
    where KK is a proportional constant mapping gas units to photon count.

    Total Energy Emitted:
    Etotal=N×EphotonEtotal​=N×Ephoton​

    Temperature Adjustment:
    Emission rates scale by 1+α(T−Tref)1+α(T−Tref​), with αα as temperature coefficient.

5. Integration with Blockchain

    The chip interfaces via event-driven signals generated on blockchain gas consumption.

    Supports manual mode: User-triggered photon emission for diagnostics.

    Supports auto mode: Real-time emission tied to live blockchain transactions.

    Software simulation layers mirror physical chip outputs for testing and visualization.
