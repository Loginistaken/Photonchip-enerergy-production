# Rose Quartz Photon Chip Insert
# Description: Full-spectrum photon emission and recycling chip using doped Rose Quartz (Mn, Al, Fe)
# This is an energy recycling add-on for the original device. It expands photon capture capabilities.
# It references the original device's energy core but enhances it with multi-dopant quantum mineral logic.

"""
OVERVIEW:
This module upgrades the existing energy device by introducing a photon chip made from Rose Quartz enriched with:
 - Manganese (Mn) for red/near-IR emissions
 - Aluminum (Al) for UV-blue emissions
 - Iron (Fe) for green-yellow photon range

Together, these dopants provide full-spectrum photon emission from UV to IR, improving thermal-to-light conversion and light recycling by up to 50%.

This photon chip insert can be added to the initial energy device without full redesign. It integrates into the Energy Capture Mesh (ECM) to enhance multi-band photon capture.
