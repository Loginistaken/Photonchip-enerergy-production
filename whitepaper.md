Physical constants and deeper photon modeling:

    Planck constant h=6.626×10−34h=6.626×10−34 Js

    Speed of light c=3×108c=3×108 m/s

    Photon energy: E=h×fE=h×f (frequency)

    Frequency related to photon wavelength λλ: f=cλf=λc​

Incorporate:

    PLANCK_CONSTANT = 6.626e-34  # Js
    SPEED_OF_LIGHT = 3e8         # m/s
    
    def __init__(self, wavelength_nm=1000, efficiency=0.85, temperature_K=300):

2. Physical Principles## 2. Physical Principles and Photonic Emission Model

- **Planck's Relation:**  
  \( E = h \times f \)  
  where  
  \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, J \cdot s \) (Planck constant),  
  \( f \) = photon frequency (Hz).

    Photon Energy Formula:
    E=h×f=hcλE=h×f=λhc​
    where:

        h=6.626×10−34h=6.626×10−34 Js (Planck’s constant)

        c=3×108c=3×108 m/s (speed of light)

        λλ = photon wavelength (dependent on chip design)

        ff = frequency

    Conversion Efficiency:
    Not all gas consumption is perfectly converted; efficiency ηη models losses.

    Temperature Effects:
    Operating temperature influences photon emission rates and energy distribution.
 Integration with Blockchain Project
Solidity contract side:

    Keep track of emitted photons & energy per transaction

    Emit events with photon counts and energy used

    Add functions to query chip stats (manual and auto mode)

Python side:

    Use the improved PhotonicChip class in your event_listener.py

    Listen to blockchain EnergyGenerated event → call chip sim → process photons/energy

    Support manual override vs auto mode (controlled by config/env variable)

Draft Solidity addition (in EnergyCrypto.sol):

// Add state to store photons emitted per address (optional)
mapping(address => uint256) public photonsEmitted;

event PhotonEmission(address indexed from, uint256 photons, uint256 energyUsed);

function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success) {
    require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= _value);

    uint256 gasBefore = gasleft();

    balanceOf[msg.sender] -= _value;
    balanceOf[_to] += _value;

    emit Transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value);

    uint256 gasAfter = gasleft();
    uint256 gasUsed = gasBefore - gasAfter;

    // Emit photons and energy event (energy calculated off-chain, but we can store photons)
    uint256 photons = gasUsed * 42; // placeholder, real calc off-chain
    photonsEmitted[msg.sender] += photons;

    emit EnergyGenerated(msg.sender, gasUsed, gasUsed * 42);
    emit PhotonEmission(msg.sender, photons, gasUsed * 42);

    return true;
}

5. Integration with Blockchain

    The chip interfaces via event-driven signals generated on blockchain gas consumption.

    Supports manual mode: User-triggered photon emission for diagnostics.

    Supports auto mode: Real-time emission tied to live blockchain transactions.

    Software simulation layers mirror physical chip outputs for testing and visualization.
   ## 5. Integration Protocols

### 5.1 Hardware Interface

- Communication via SPI bus at 10 MHz clock rate.
- Control registers exposed for:
  - Mode selection (manual vs auto)
  - Photon emission scaling factor \( k \)
  - Status and error flags

### 5.2 Software Interaction

- **Manual Mode:**  
  Software sends explicit gas usage counts to the chip per transaction via SPI writes.

- **Auto Mode:**  
  Chip monitors operation bus signals directly to compute gas usage internally and emit photons autonomously.

- **Event Signaling:**  
  Chip asserts interrupt line to notify software on photon emission completion or errors.

### 5.3 Blockchain Node Integration

- Software listens to chip events (photon counts and energy output).
- Adjusts blockchain simulation parameters dynamically based on emitted energy.
- Enables fallback to manual mode if auto signals are unavailable.
