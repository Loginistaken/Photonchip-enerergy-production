Hardware Oracle + Photonic Meter:
The device is a physical blockchain oracle and photonic meter. It processes and verifies transactions, then emits real photons proportionally
to computational “gas” cost, making blockchain computation visible as light output.

Energy Efficiency & Recycling
Code

Energy Capture & Reuse:
The device uses an Energy Capture Mesh (ECM) and Power Core to recapture some emitted light and heat, recycling it for internal power.
Net Energy Use Calculation:
Only net energy (after recycling) is used to determine photon emission and gas cost:
effective_gas = gas_used × (1 - recycle_efficiency)
This reduces true energy consumption and transaction costs.

Photonic Design Relevance (for Optical Cord Design)
Code

Photon Emission as Output:
The optical cord must channel emitted photons efficiently from the Photon Emission Diode (PED) to the measurement or visualization interface.
Energy Recycling Integration:
The optical system should allow for some photons to be captured by the ECM for recycling, not just transmitted.
Thermal and Light Management:
The optical cord should minimize losses, avoid overheating, and possibly use light-pipe or fiberoptic structures for high efficiency.
Spectral Consistency:
As photon frequency relates to computational cost, the cord design should ensure accurate transmission without spectral distortion.

Firmware & Device Behavior (Relevant to Optical Cord):
Code

Reads contract and transaction data.
Calculates photon output:
frequency = effective_gas × constant,
energy = Planck × frequency
Emits photons accordingly and displays/logs results.
Controls recycling functions and displays real-time energy, gas, and photon data.

C++

#include <cstdint>

// Physical constants const double ELECTRON_CHARGE = 1.602e-19; // Coulombs

// Calculate the number of photons absorbed and the generated current // incident_photons: number of photons incident on the device
// quantum_efficiency: fraction (0 to 1) of photons absorbed (depends on material, doping, wavelength) struct AbsorptionResult 
{ uint64_t photons_absorbed; double generated_current; // in Amperes };

AbsorptionResult calculate_absorption(uint64_t incident_photons, double quantum_efficiency, double time_interval_sec) 
{ AbsorptionResult result; result.photons_absorbed = static_cast<uint64_t>(incident_photons * quantum_efficiency); 
// Each absorbed photon releases one electron (ideal case) uint64_t electrons = result.photons_absorbed; 
double total_charge = electrons * ELECTRON_CHARGE; 
// Current = charge / time result.generated_current = total_charge / time_interval_sec; return result; }

Key Points:
Code

Quantum efficiency depends on doping/material and wavelength. You can tune this to simulate Mn, Fe, P, or Si for IR, UV, or visible light.
No dimming: If your optic cord is semi-transparent or selectively couples photons out of the LED beam, 
the display brightness can be largely preserved.
Doped silicon: Doping and the crystal structure affect quantum efficiency and the spectral response. 
You can model this in code by setting quantum_efficiency based on the material and wavelength.

2. Physics & Material Integration
Code

Material Properties:
    Doping with Mn, Fe, P changes the bandgap and absorption spectrum.
    For IR, UV, and green, the absorption coefficient and efficiency are different. 
    You can use tables or formulas for each material/wavelength combo.
Photon Energy:
    E p h o t o n
    For each wavelength, calculate energy per photon.
Current Generation:
    Each absorbed photon (if quantum efficiency = 1) releases one electron, generating charge and current.
Integration with LED:
    A lens or doped crystal placed over the LED can redirect a small portion of light into the optic cord
    without significantly reducing screen brightness if optimized for partial coupling.

3. Explanation of Your Device

You’ve created a silicon-based photon device that:
Code

Uses a doped silicon/metal crystal (Mn, Fe, P) to match the spectrum of the LED (IR, UV, green).
Is mounted directly over the LED with a transparent/opaque lens to couple a fraction of light into an optical cord.
The optic cord channels captured photons to your photon device, where they are converted
into electrical current for energy recycling or measurement.
The design ensures minimal impact on screen brightness (“without dimming”) by only
extracting a controlled fraction of photons.

4. Example Rewrite of Your Process (for Documentation or Code Comments)
Code

"Our silicon photon device integrates a doped silicon (Mn, Fe, P) crystal lens directly over a computer’s LED.
The lens is engineered for selective spectral absorption (IR/UV/green), allowing a portion of the LED’s 
light to be captured by an optic cord while the majority passes through, preserving display brightness. 
Absorbed photons are converted into electrical current via the photoelectric effect, 
with the generated charge calculated as Q , and current as I . Material doping and quantum efficiency 
are tuned for optimal conversion at the target wavelength, maximizing energy recycling without visual loss."

5. Recommendations
Code

Use the improved code structure above.
In your firmware/software, allow the quantum efficiency to be a material/wavelength-dependent parameter.
If possible, measure actual current generated from your device in practice and calibrate your quantum efficiency.
For more advanced modeling, include spectral response curves and real absorption data for your specific doped silicon or other materials.
Document the optical coupling fraction (how much light is diverted into the optic cord) as part of your energy accounting.
